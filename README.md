# ∞ Go React Full Stack ∞ 

I haven't touched Vite since [NyumatFlix](https://github.com/Nyumat/NyumatFlix) so I thought I'd hop back on the wave. 

Instead of using Node.js like I usually do for the server-side, we'll be using Go and specifically Fiber.

<!-- 
## Some Specs
- Go
- Fiber
- Vite
- Mantine
- TypeScript -->

### Todo List:
      - Graceful error handling on both ends
      - Decide on a project scope? (Todos/School System/IDK Yet)
      - Complete all routes in BE router
      - Add npm script command to concurrently run both FE and BE
